According to the question 

The minimum avg height of the car:-2 meters.

The height of the senor placed on the ceiling from the ground:-5 meters.

That implies that if a car of standard height(ie > 2 meters)  enters the parking lot the distance between the ceiling and the sensor is < 3 meters {(5-3) meters = 2 meters}.

So the circuit design made by me turns the LED GREEN if there is no car(taller than 2 meters) ðŸš™ in the parking lot(near the sensor) which implies the the place is empty.
Else it turns on RED LED which implies that there is some car of height greater than 2 meters.
