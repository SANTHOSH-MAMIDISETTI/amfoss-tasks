ðŸ‘‰Why must we choose you?

Well until my 12 class though i knew nothing about coding ,programming etcI had passion for computers,an insight on technology and most importantly i was only in a tought of making use of these computers to change the way we (or atleast I) live.For that i am passionate and ready to contribute what i have learnt into the society,for my dream to come true all i know is that i have get myself placed in a community like the Amfoss.This organization will surely prove to be an excellent platform for me to establish my skills and knowledge in the society as well as among my peer groups.


ðŸ‘‰What is your plan for the next 6 months?

   After seeing the tasks i was confirmed and  understood the thing that I knew nothing.Hence i would like to devote my time to start learning the things which i don't know as well as finishing the things which I only learnt to some extent (due to lack of time) fully.


ðŸ‘‰How would you contribute back to the club?

   Share all my knowledge resources and my experiences with my peer group in such a way that everyon will find it useful and can learn something from it irrespective of their expertise.


ðŸ‘‰Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

    Yes,though I found the selection process fine but it would be even more better if much more time is given with respect to the tasks as some or difficult while the others are lengthy, I think it would be better if even learning typing is made one of the tasks as it plays a vital role.
