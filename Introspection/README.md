ðŸ‘‰Why must we choose you?

Well until my 12 class though I knew nothing about coding ,programming etc I have passion for computers,an insight on technology and most importantly I was in a thought of making use of these computers to change the way we (or atleast I) live.For that I am passionate and ready to contribute what I have learnt into this society.TO make my dream true i have put myself in a community like the Amfoss.This organization is surely an excellent platform for me to establish my skills and knowledge in the society as well as among my peer groups.


ðŸ‘‰What is your plan for the next 6 months?

   After seeing the tasks I have come to a confirmation that I knew nothing.So I would like to feal all my time to start learning as well as finishing the things which I have left only learnt to some extent (due to lack of time) fully.


ðŸ‘‰How would you contribute back to the club?

   I would like to share all my knowledge, resources and my experiences in a proper way such that everyone will find it more reliable and can learn something from it irrespective of their experience.


ðŸ‘‰Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

   Yes,based on my experience I found that the selection process was vey cool ðŸ˜Ž but it would be even more better if the time limit is extended for the tasks given as some of the tasks were difficult and lengthy. I think it would be better even typing was made one of the task's as it plays a vital role in any work.This was just my idea based on the experience I have travelled with U.
