# AMFOSS-TASKS
(repository with amfoss tasks done by SANTHOSH_MAMIDISETTI )

I am SANTHOSH_MAMIDISETTI from ANDHRA PRADESH ,fresher at Amrita School of Engineering(CSE AI 2021)


I myself have not completed all the tasks so I can directly say that they were difficult and most of them were out of range for freshers like me particularly for students like me(from Andhra Pradesh) who will not have any background of programming.They were so amazing(as well as difficut) that i cannot have a particular word to describe them.They challange us to increase our knowledge that is the best part of it.The tasks are designed to cultivate the habit of self learning in which they are helphul(but be disastrous to students from positon) atleast in my case.

My Introduction

Dear  Seniors  I am Santhosh from Andhra Pradesh.I came to know about amFOSS from quora since then it made me curious. I felt the club will provide me good opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge.I knew nothing in the field of coding even a hello world c program..!!! all the things which i knew now were only by the tasks of Amfoss club
which helped me in learning.
